            <Letra>First things first&#13;
I'ma say all the words inside my head&#13;
I'm fired up and tired of the way that things have been, oh-ooh&#13;
The way that things have been, oh-ooh&#13;
Second thing second&#13;
Don't you tell me what you think that I could be&#13;
I'm the one at the sail, I'm the master of my sea, oh-ooh&#13;
The master of my sea, oh-ooh&#13;
I was broken from a young age&#13;
Taking my sulking to the masses&#13;
Writing my poems for the few&#13;
That look at me, took to me, shook to me, feeling me&#13;
Singing from heartache from the pain&#13;
Taking my message from the veins&#13;
Speaking my lesson from the brain&#13;
Seeing the beauty through the...&#13;
Pain!&#13;
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer&#13;
Pain!&#13;
You break me down and build me up, believer, believer&#13;
Pain!&#13;
Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain&#13;
My life, my love, my drive, it came from...&#13;
Pain!&#13;
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer&#13;
First things first&#13;
Can you imagine what's about to happen?&#13;
It's Weezy the Dragon, I link with the Dragons&#13;
And we gon' get ratchet, no need for imaginin'&#13;
This is what's happenin'&#13;
Second thing second, I reckon immaculate&#13;
Sound about accurate&#13;
I know that strength, it don't come, don't come without strategy&#13;
I know the sweet, it don't come without cavities&#13;
I know the passages come with some traffic&#13;
I start with from the basement, end up in the attic&#13;
And third thing third&#13;
Whoever call me out, they simply can't count&#13;
Let's get mathematic, I'm up in this, huh&#13;
Is you a believer?&#13;
I get a unicorn out of a zebra&#13;
I wear my uniform like a tuxedo&#13;
This dragon don't hold his breath, don't need no breather&#13;
Love you Ms. Cita, the son of a leader&#13;
I know the bloomin' don't come without rain&#13;
I know the losin' don't come without shame&#13;
I know the beauty don't come without hurt&#13;
Hol' up, hol' up, last thing last&#13;
I know that Tunechi don't come without Wayne&#13;
I know that losin' don't come without game&#13;
I know that glory don't come without...&#13;
Don't come without...&#13;
Pain!&#13;
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer&#13;
Pain!&#13;
You break me down and build me up, believer, believer&#13;
Pain&#13;
Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain&#13;
My life, my love, my drive, it came from...&#13;
Pain!&#13;
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer&#13;
Last things last&#13;
By the grace of fire and flames&#13;
You're the face of the future, the blood in my veins, oh-ooh&#13;
The blood in my veins, oh-ooh&#13;
But they never did, ever lived, ebbing and flowing&#13;
Inhibited, limited 'til it broke open and rained down&#13;
It rained down, like...&#13;
Pain!&#13;
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer&#13;
Pain!&#13;
You break me down and build me up, believer, believer&#13;
Pain&#13;
Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain&#13;
My life, my love, my drive, it came from...&#13;
Pain!&#13;
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer</Letra>

            <Letra>Gimme, gimme, gimme some time to think&#13;
I'm in the bathroom, looking at me&#13;
Face in the mirror is all I need (ooh)&#13;
Wait until the reaper takes my life&#13;
Never gonna get me out alive&#13;
I will live a thousand million lives (ooh)&#13;
My patience is waning&#13;
Is this entertaining?&#13;
Our patience is waning&#13;
Is this entertaining?&#13;
I-I-I got this feeling, yeah, you know&#13;
Where I'm losing all control&#13;
'Cause there's magic in my bones&#13;
I-I-I got this feeling in my soul&#13;
Go ahead and throw your stones&#13;
'Cause there's magic in my bones&#13;
Playing with a stick of dynamite&#13;
There was never gray in black and white&#13;
There was never wrong 'til there was right (ooh, oh)&#13;
Feeling like a boulder hurtling&#13;
Seeing all the vultures circling&#13;
Burning in the flames I'm working in&#13;
Turning in a bed that's darkening&#13;
My patience is waning&#13;
Is this entertaining?&#13;
Our patience is waning&#13;
Is this entertaining?&#13;
I-I-I got this feeling, yeah, you know&#13;
Where I'm losing all control&#13;
'Cause there's magic in my bones (in my bones)&#13;
I-I-I got this feeling in my soul&#13;
Go ahead and throw your stones&#13;
'Cause there's magic in my bones&#13;
'Cause there's magic in my bones&#13;
Look in the mirror of my mind&#13;
Turning the pages of my life&#13;
Walking the path so many paced a million times&#13;
Drown out the voices in the air&#13;
Leaving the ones that never cared&#13;
Picking the pieces up and building to the sky&#13;
My patience is waning&#13;
Is this entertaining?&#13;
My patience is waning&#13;
Is this entertaining?&#13;
I-I-I got this feeling, yeah, you know&#13;
Where I'm losing all control&#13;
'Cause there's magic in my bones (magic in my bones)&#13;
I-I-I got this feeling in my soul (soul)&#13;
Go ahead and throw your stones&#13;
'Cause there's magic in&#13;
There goes my mind (I-I-I)&#13;
Don't mind&#13;
There goes my mind (there it goes, there it goes)&#13;
There goes my mind (I-I-I)&#13;
Don't mind (there it goes)&#13;
There goes my mind&#13;
'Cause there's magic in my bones</Letra>

            <Letra>When the days are cold&#13;
And the cards all fold&#13;
And the saints we see are all made of gold&#13;
When your dreams all fail&#13;
And the ones we hail&#13;
Are the worst of all, and the blood's run stale&#13;
I wanna hide the truth&#13;
I wanna shelter you&#13;
But with the beast inside&#13;
There's nowhere we can hide&#13;
No matter what we breed&#13;
We still are made of greed&#13;
This is my kingdom come&#13;
This is my kingdom come&#13;
When you feel my heat, look into my eyes&#13;
It's where my demons hide&#13;
It's where my demons hide&#13;
Don't get too close, it's dark inside&#13;
It's where my demons hide&#13;
It's where my demons hide&#13;
At the curtain's call&#13;
It's the last of all&#13;
When the lights fade out, all the sinners crawl&#13;
So they dug your grave&#13;
And the masquerade&#13;
Will come calling out at the mess you've made&#13;
Don't wanna let you down&#13;
But I am hell-bound&#13;
Though this is all for you&#13;
Don't wanna hide the truth&#13;
No matter what we breed&#13;
We still are made of greed&#13;
This is my kingdom come&#13;
This is my kingdom come&#13;
When you feel my heat, look into my eyes&#13;
It's where my demons hide&#13;
It's where my demons hide&#13;
Don't get too close, it's dark inside&#13;
It's where my demons hide&#13;
It's where my demons hide&#13;
They say it's what you make&#13;
I say it's up to fate&#13;
It's woven in my soul&#13;
I need to let you go&#13;
Your eyes, they shine so bright&#13;
I wanna save that light&#13;
I can't escape this now&#13;
Unless you show me how&#13;
When you feel my heat, look into my eyes&#13;
It's where my demons hide&#13;
It's where my demons hide&#13;
Don't get too close, it's dark inside&#13;
It's where my demons hide&#13;
It's where my demons hide</Letra>

            <Letra>Look out for yourself&#13;
I wake up to the sounds of the silence that allows&#13;
For my mind to run around with my ear up to the ground&#13;
I'm searching to behold the stories that are told&#13;
When my back is to the world that was smiling when I turned&#13;
Tell you, you're the greatest&#13;
But once you turn, they hate us&#13;
Oh, the misery&#13;
Everybody wants to be my enemy&#13;
Spare the sympathy&#13;
Everybody wants to be my enemy&#13;
Look out for yourself&#13;
My enemy&#13;
Look out for yourself&#13;
But I'm ready&#13;
Your words up on the wall as you're praying for my fall&#13;
And the laughter in the halls&#13;
And the names that I've been called&#13;
I stack it in my mind and I'm waiting for the time&#13;
When I show you what it's like to be words spit in a mic&#13;
Tell you, you're the greatest&#13;
But once you turn, they hate us (ha)&#13;
Oh, the misery&#13;
Everybody wants to be my enemy&#13;
Spare the sympathy&#13;
Everybody wants to be my enemy&#13;
Look out for yourself&#13;
My enemy (yeah)&#13;
Look out for yourself&#13;
Uh, look, okay&#13;
I'm hoping that somebody pray for me&#13;
I'm praying that somebody hope for me&#13;
I'm staying where nobody 'posed to be&#13;
Posted, being a wreck of emotions&#13;
Ready to go whenever, just let me know&#13;
The road is long, so put the pedal into the floor&#13;
The enemy on my trail, my energy unavailable&#13;
I'ma tell 'em, "Hasta luego"&#13;
They wanna plot on my trot to the top&#13;
I've been outta shape, thinkin' out the box&#13;
I'm an astronaut, I blasted off the planet rock&#13;
To cause catastrophe and it matters more because I had it&#13;
And I had a thought about wreaking havoc on an opposition, kinda shockin'&#13;
They want a static with precision, I'm automatic quarterback&#13;
I ain't talking sacking pack it, pack it up, I don't panic, batter-batter up&#13;
Who the baddest? It don't matter 'cause we at ya throat&#13;
Everybody wants to be my enemy&#13;
Spare the sympathy&#13;
Everybody wants to be my enemy&#13;
Oh, the misery&#13;
Everybody wants to be my enemy&#13;
Spare the sympathy&#13;
Everybody wants to be my enemy (I swear)&#13;
Pray it away, I swear, I never be a saint, no way&#13;
My enemy&#13;
Pray it away, I swear, I never be a saint&#13;
Look out for yourself</Letra>

Whoa, oh, oh&#13;
Whoa, oh, oh&#13;
Whoa&#13;
I'm waking up to ash and dust&#13;
I wipe my brow and I sweat my rust&#13;
I'm breathing in the chemicals&#13;
I'm breaking in, shaping up, then checking out on the prison bus&#13;
This is it, the apocalypse&#13;
Whoa&#13;
I'm waking up, I feel it in my bones&#13;
Enough to make my systems blow&#13;
Welcome to the new age, to the new age&#13;
Welcome to the new age, to the new age&#13;
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, whoa, oh, oh, oh, I'm radioactive, radioactive&#13;
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, whoa, oh, oh, oh, I'm radioactive, radioactive&#13;
I raise my flags, don my clothes&#13;
It's a revolution, I suppose&#13;
We'll paint it red to fit right in&#13;
Whoa&#13;
I'm breaking in, shaping up, then checking out on the prison bus&#13;
This is it, the apocalypse&#13;
Whoa&#13;
I'm waking up, I feel it in my bones&#13;
Enough to make my systems blow&#13;
Welcome to the new age, to the new age&#13;
Welcome to the new age, to the new age&#13;
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, whoa, oh, oh, oh, I'm radioactive, radioactive&#13;
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, whoa, oh, oh, oh, I'm radioactive, radioactive&#13;
All systems go, the sun hasn't died&#13;
Deep in my bones, straight from inside&#13;
I'm waking up, I feel it in my bones&#13;
Enough to make my systems blow&#13;
Welcome to the new age, to the new age&#13;
Welcome to the new age, to the new age&#13;
