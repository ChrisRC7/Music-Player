I wake up to the sounds of the silence that allows&#13;
For my mind to run around with my ear up to the ground&#13;
I'm searching to behold the stories that are told&#13;
When my back is to the world that was smiling when I turned&#13;
Tell you, you're the greatest&#13;
But once you turn, they hate us&#13;
Oh, the misery&#13;
Everybody wants to be my enemy&#13;
Spare the sympathy&#13;
Everybody wants to be my enemy&#13;
Look out for yourself&#13;
My enemy&#13;
Look out for yourself&#13;
But I'm ready&#13;
Your words up on the wall as you're praying for my fall&#13;
And the laughter in the halls&#13;
And the names that I've been called&#13;
I stack it in my mind and I'm waiting for the time&#13;
When I show you what it's like to be words spit in a mic&#13;
Tell you, you're the greatest&#13;
But once you turn, they hate us (ha)&#13;
Oh, the misery&#13;
Everybody wants to be my enemy&#13;
Spare the sympathy&#13;
Everybody wants to be my enemy&#13;
Look out for yourself&#13;
My enemy (yeah)&#13;
Look out for yourself&#13;
Uh, look, okay&#13;
I'm hoping that somebody pray for me&#13;
I'm praying that somebody hope for me&#13;
I'm staying where nobody 'posed to be&#13;
Posted, being a wreck of emotions&#13;
Ready to go whenever, just let me know&#13;
The road is long, so put the pedal into the floor&#13;
The enemy on my trail, my energy unavailable&#13;
I'ma tell 'em, "Hasta luego"&#13;
They wanna plot on my trot to the top&#13;
I've been outta shape, thinkin' out the box&#13;
I'm an astronaut, I blasted off the planet rock&#13;
To cause catastrophe and it matters more because I had it&#13;
And I had a thought about wreaking havoc on an opposition, kinda shockin'&#13;
They want a static with precision, I'm automatic quarterback&#13;
I ain't talking sacking pack it, pack it up, I don't panic, batter-batter up&#13;
Who the baddest? It don't matter 'cause we at ya throat&#13;
Everybody wants to be my enemy&#13;
Spare the sympathy&#13;
Everybody wants to be my enemy&#13;
Oh, the misery&#13;
Everybody wants to be my enemy&#13;
Spare the sympathy&#13;
Everybody wants to be my enemy (I swear)&#13;
Pray it away, I swear, I never be a saint, no way&#13;
My enemy&#13;
Pray it away, I swear, I never be a saint&#13;
